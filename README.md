# CS-350 Emerging System Architecture

## Project Overview

This repository contains projects developed during the CS-350 Emerging System Architecture course, focusing on embedded systems programming using the Texas Instruments CC3220S microcontroller. Key projects include:

1. **Morse Code Project**: Configured LEDs to blink messages such as "HELP" and "OTW," translating text into Morse code through light signals.

2. **Single Byte Project**: Controlled an LED based on user input, turning it on or off when 'n' or 'f' was entered, respectively.

## Achievements

- **Modular and Reusable Code**: Emphasized creating modular code components, facilitating easy integration and expansion across projects.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Utilized descriptive naming conventions and thorough comments to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Adaptability to Challenges**: Aimed to improve adaptability when encountering outdated coursework materials by proactively seeking updated resources and solutions.

## Resources Added to Support Network

- **Embedded Systems Knowledge**: Gained foundational experience in embedded systems programming, particularly with microcontrollers like the CC3220S.
- **Community Engagement**: Leveraged platforms such as Reddit and Stack Overflow, along with peer collaboration, to overcome challenges and deepen understanding.

## Transferable Skills

- **Code Modularization and Reusability**: Developed skills in creating modular code structures, enhancing efficiency in future projects.
- **Effective Documentation**: Practiced writing clear and concise comments, improving code readability and facilitating easier maintenance.

## Maintenance and Adaptability Strategies

- **Modular Design**: Structured code into distinct modules, allowing for straightforward updates and scalability.
- **Descriptive Naming Conventions**: Employed clear and descriptive names for variables and functions to reduce ambiguity.
- **Thorough Commenting**: Provided detailed comments to document thought processes and code functionality, aiding future development and debugging.

This repository showcases a journey through embedded systems projects, highlighting both accomplishments and areas for growth, while emphasizing the importance of modular design and comprehensive documentation in software development.
