# CS-350-Emerging-System-Architecture

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The two projects that I felt that I did well on were the Morse code and the Single Byte project, In the Morse code project we had to make it so that the LEDs would blink to our chosen message in my case I did "help" and "OTW" for the two messages that were sent and shown in the blinking lights. In the Single byte project, we had to turn on or off an LED based on whether or not the user types an 'n' or an 'f'.
    
### What did you do particularly well?
    I think I made good use of reusable code and made it modular so that I could easily add bits and pieces as needed for my projects to work. Another thing I did well was use comments to my advantage to try and describe what I was thinking at the time.
    
### Where could you improve?
    I found this class to be very challenging, especially with a lot of the coursework being out of date. One thing that I can improve on is being more adaptive when hitting roadblocks and accepting newer material when needed.
    
### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    I think this class has taught me more about embedded coding as I haven't ever looked at or considered how embedded systems work or how they are programmed. I had a little experience with messing with an embedded system (mainly in using a Raspberry Pi) but past that I never fully coded a program to run on them. I definitely had a lot of help in this course both from websites like Reddit and StackOverflow and from other people taking this course with me.
    
### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    I think like all of my other classes this one has taught me new skills that I can use in the future as well as reinforcing previously learned skills like modulization and reusability.
    
### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    As I said previously, the use of modules and reusable code helped a lot to make my code more maintainable and adaptable. I used names that were descriptive to not confuse others, and the use of comments helped to share my thoughts when coding.
